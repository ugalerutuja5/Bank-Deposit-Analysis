# Bank-Deposit-Analysis
# The Portuguese Bank had run a telemarketing campaign in the past, making sales calls for a term-deposit product. Whether a prospect had bought the product or not is mentioned in the column named 'response'.

# The marketing team wants to launch another campaign, and they want to learn from the past one. You, as an analyst, decide to build a supervised model in R/Python and achieve the following goals:

# Reduce the marketing cost by X% and acquire Y% of the prospects (compared to random calling), where X and Y are to be maximized
# Present the financial benefit of this project to the marketing team
